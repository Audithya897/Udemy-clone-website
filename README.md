## 🎓 Udemy Clone – HTML & CSS Only

A clean, responsive **Udemy website clone** built entirely with **HTML5** and **CSS3**. This project replicates the front-end design of the popular online course platform, offering an intuitive layout, visually appealing course cards, and a professional look — all without a single line of JavaScript.

This project is perfect for front-end beginners and intermediate developers looking to practice and improve their HTML/CSS skills by recreating real-world website layouts.
